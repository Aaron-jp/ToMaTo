 The Topology Management Tool (ToMaTo) is a networking testbed, giving 
researchers the possibility to design and use virtual networking 
topologies consisting of devices and connectors. ToMaTo utilizes Proxmox 
virtualization technology (OpenVZ and KVM), Tinc VPN and Dummynet link 
emulation to organize virtual machines in virtual topologies.
