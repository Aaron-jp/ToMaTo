<h1>Connection Configuration Window</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Here you can set link emulation and packet capturing for network connections.</p>

<h2>Link Emulation</h2>

<h3>Guarantees</h3>
<p>Connections between different sites use the Internet and are therefore subject to the Internet's best-effort guarantee.
Thus, additional delay may apply and it may happen that you don't get the full bandwidth.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>You can set different directions for each direction.</p>
<p>The easiest way to determine a direction is to look at the arrow in the direction field.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td>Bandwidth</td>
<td>Bandwidth in kbit/s in one direction. Note that the two directions are seperate channels.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Delay</td>
<td>Delay in ms for the packet.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Jitter</td>
<td>Random jitter range for the delay in ms. The jitter will be added to or subtracted from the delay.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Distribution</td>
<td>Distribution for the jitter.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Loss Ratio</td>
<td>Loss ratio in % to be applied to packets.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Duplication Ratio</td>
<td>Duplication ratio in % to be applied to packets.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Corruption Ratio</td>
<td>Corruption ratio in % to be applied to packets.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h2>Packet Capturing</h2>
<p>Captured packets can either be downloaded or viewed live.
Downloadable Packets can be sent directly to Cloudshark for viewing (With a limit of 10MB).</p>
<p>You can get the captures from the connection's right-click menu.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td>Capture Mode</td>
<td>For download: Download for Wireshark or Cloudshark.<br/>Via network: Live Viewing</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Packet filter expression</td>
<td>Filter packets by a wireshark filter. More information at the <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark-filter.html">wireshark-filter</a> man page.</td>
</tr>

</table>
