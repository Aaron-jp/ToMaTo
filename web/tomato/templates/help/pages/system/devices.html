<h1>Devices</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>


<h2>States</h2>
<h3>Created</h3>
<p>A device which is created does not exist as a virtual machine yet.
"created" means the device is defined in a topology. It also doesn't have a disk image.</p>

<h3>Prepared</h3>
<p>A prepared device does exist as a virtual machine with its own disk image.</p>
<p>When becoming prepared, the disk image will be created from the set <a href="{%url main.help 'system/device_template'%}">template</a>.
This disk image will be deleted when the device gets destroyed.</p>
<p>A prepared device is not running.</p>

<h3>Started</h3>
<p>A started device is a running virtual machine.</p>



<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>Devices are represented by computer icons.</p>
<p>You can determine the state of a device by its attached icon. A created device does not have an icon attached to it; a prepared device has a <img src="/img/prepared.png"/> and a started device has a <img src="/img/started.png"/> on it.
