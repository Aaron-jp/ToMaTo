Helpful Hints:

To create nodes, drag them from the bar on the left into the work area
in the middle.

To link all currently selected node(s)/lan(s) to another node/lan, hold
ctrl and click on that node/lan.

To select multiple items, use a sweeping rectangle or hold shift (or
both.) Use this to change parameters for a large group of things at once.
