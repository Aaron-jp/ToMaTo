Description: network simulation tool
 dummynet is a tool originally designed for testing networking protocols, and
 since then used for a variety of applications including bandwidth management.
 It simulates/enforces queue and bandwidth limitations, delays, packet losses,
 and multipath effects. It also implements a variant of Weighted Fair Queueing
 called WF2Q+. It can be used on user's workstations, or on machines acting as
 routers or bridges.
